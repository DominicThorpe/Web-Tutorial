# FarmApp: An Agriculture-Themed Teaching Project for Modern Python, HTML, CSS, and JS

<span style="color: red;">This project and associated teaching are in no way affiliated with the Royal Agricultural University.</span>

In the modern agricultural workplace, technology is becoming increasingly essential, and a working knowledge of programming and scripting is a useful tool for any employee, manager, or business owner. This course aims to equip you with a basic foundation in the development of simple, visual applications which interact with a backend database and performs simple data processing with a project which is relevant for those pursuing agriculture or land-management-related professional goals.

### ***I highly recommend you take [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFrLs22MDAw&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-mFu00qxl0a67RhjjZj3jXm&index=1) course before/whilst following this course and watch at least the first 12 videos.***

## Learning Objectives

### What You Will Learn

Upon completion of this course you should have a basic understanding of the following:
 1. How to create and style webpages with HTML and CSS and use the styling framework Bootstrap 5,
 2. How to connect to and use web APIs using JavaScript
 3. How to create endpoints and perform simple data processing using the Python library Flask
 4. How to design an SQL database and interact with it

## Setup

First, install the Python programming language, the VSCode integrated development environment (IDE), and the version manager Git by following the instructions which can be found at these websites:
 - Python: [download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - VSCode: [download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
 - Git: [download here](https://git-scm.com/install/)

I advise you regularly back-up your work to [GitHub](https://github.com/) to avoid loss of work.

Once you have a Flask setup, run it by running this command, making sure to `cd <project directory>` into the correct folder first:

`python -m flask --app main run --debug`
