# FarmApp: An Agriculture-Themed Teaching Project for Modern Python, HTML, CSS, and JS

<span style="color: red;">This project and associated teaching are in no way affiliated with the Royal Agricultural University.</span>

In the modern agricultural workplace, technology is becoming increasingly essential, and a working knowledge of programming and scripting is a useful tool for any employee, manager, or business owner. This course aims to equip you with a basic foundation in the development of simple, visual applications which interact with a backend database and performs simple data processing with a project which is relevant for those pursuing agriculture or land-management-related professional goals.
