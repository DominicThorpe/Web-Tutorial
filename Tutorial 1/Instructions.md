# Tutorial One

Hello and welcome to this first tutorial on how to use Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a simple dashboard on a farm, its fields, and their performance. We will cover developing the frontend (the part you see), the backend (the part which goes on in the background), and the database (the part which stores the data).

If you have any questions, email me at Dominic.Thorpe@rau.ac.uk, and some extra resources will be linked which should answer most questions.

## Installing Key Dependencies

**To follow this tutorial you will need Python**. How to install python and Flask varies from computer to computer so follow the instructions on the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then, install Flask by opening a console window and typing `pip install Flask`.

You may also want a proper code editor to make formatting, reading, and running code easier. I recommend VS Code, which can be found on their main website [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Getting Started With Flask

Follow along in the tutorial to learn how to use Flask to create a simple, static webpage which will be the starting point of the whole application. When you want to run the program, use the following command in the console, making sure you are in the correct directory:

`python -m flask --app main run --debug`
